# DUKAAN

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive procurement and inventory management system designed to streamline order processing, vendor communication, and customer invoicing. It consists of the following three main components:

1. **Chatbot for Procurement and Tracking** – A WhatsApp chatbot that allows users to place orders, track orders, and automatically send email notifications to vendors.
2. **Web App for Inventory Management** – A web-based dashboard for managing inventory, tracking stock levels, and handling procurement orders efficiently.
3. **Invoice Generation & Customer Email Notifications** – Automated invoice generation for completed orders, with email notifications sent to customers.

## Features & Technologies Used

### 1. Chatbot for Procurement and Tracking

- Developed using **Twilio WhatsApp API** to handle order placement and tracking.
- Uses **Redis** for caching frequently accessed data, reducing response time.
- Automatically extracts vendor details and sends email notifications using **SMTP**.
- Secure authentication using **OTP + JWT**.
- Kafka-based event-driven architecture for order processing.

### 2. Web App for Inventory Management

- Built using a **sharded database** architecture across 4 regions for optimized performance.
- Supports real-time inventory tracking and procurement requests.
- Containerized using **Docker** for seamless deployment and scalability.
- Kafka integration for efficient stock updates and event-driven operations.

### 3. Invoice Generation & Customer Email Notifications

- Generates invoices automatically upon order completion.
- Sends invoice details to customers via email.
- Kafka-based event handling ensures reliability in processing and sending invoices.
- Uses **Redis** for caching order details and reducing load on the primary database.

## Deployment & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed
- Kafka cluster setup
- Redis for caching
- PostgreSQL (sharded across 4 regions)
- Twilio account for chatbot functionality

### Running the System

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/procurement-chatbot.git
   cd procurement-chatbot
   ```
2. Set up environment variables for authentication (Twilio, email, database, etc.).
3. Start Docker containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
4. Ensure Kafka brokers and Redis are running properly.
5. Access the chatbot via WhatsApp and the web app via your browser.

## Future Enhancements

- AI-powered insights for inventory demand forecasting.
- Multi-vendor marketplace integration.
- Support for additional messaging platforms (Telegram, Slack, etc.).

This system is providing a powerful and scalable solution for procurement, inventory management, and invoicing, leveraging cutting-edge technologies to ensure efficiency and reliability
